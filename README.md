# graph-test-case-generation
Given graph generation code works for generation of test cases for a graph.
It tries keeping graph as deep as possible i.e. distance between 1st node and nth node is not easily reachable.
It is written to create N test files given as an input by user.

It takes 2 arguments randomly which are,

fil - number of test files you want having a graph.

cnt - initial value of file number.

It then builds a graph across it keeping graph's flow as deep as possible.

Any modifications are always appreciated.

Happy Coding!
