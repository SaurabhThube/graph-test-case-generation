# graph-test-case-generation
Given graph generation code works for generation of test cases for a graph.
It tries keeping graph as deep as possible i.e. distance between 1st node and nth node is not easily reachable.
It is written to create N test files given as an input by user however, you can modify it as freely as possible as per your requirements.
It takes 2 arguments randomly which are,
n - number of nodes in the graph.
m - number of edges in the graph.
It then builds a graph across it keeping graph's flow as deep as possible.

Any modifications are always appreciated.

Happy Coding!
